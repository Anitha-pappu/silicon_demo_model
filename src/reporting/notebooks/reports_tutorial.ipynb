    "This module\n",
    "- Provides functionality for assembling custom reports.  \n",
    "   These reports can be composed choosing the most suitable content to be helpful during team PS, client interaction etc..\n",
    "- Additionally provides four out-of-the-box reports (see `plot_batches_profiles`, `plot_sensor_trends`, `plot_feature_overviews`, `get_modeling_overview` for more details)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Report composition is distinct from report generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `reporting` pacakge, \"report\" refers to the concept of a nested structure of sections, comprising of header and content.  \n",

    "- a (nested) dictionary, which will then be used to create subheaders and subsections within a section\n",
